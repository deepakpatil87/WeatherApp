<p>
    Weather app is a simple forecast app, which uses some APIs to fetch 5 days / 3-hour forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap. We are fetching, cities, counties, latitude, and longitude, etc. from google map on click and show on Home Screen. On click city, we can get current weather and 5 days forecast. The main goal of this app is to be a sample of how to build a high-quality Android application that uses the architecture pattern, Android Jetpack component, etc. in Kotlin.
